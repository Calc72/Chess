# Chess
A small chess game where you can play against a friend or fight against a (dumb) robot.

Instructions:

  To select a piece, click it.
  
  To deselect a piece, click it a second time.
  
  Available moves show up as light green squares, click on a light green square to move your piece there.
  En Passant and Castle moves show up as yellow squares, click on the square to perform the move.


  Press Space to make the robot execute a single move.  The robot only works for the black team.


  There is a panel on the bottom with four buttons, click a button to activate its function.
  Only one button may be pressed at a time, and selecting a second button will deselect the first one.
  
  The functions of the buttons are as follows:
  
  Control: Displays all squares that a team can occupy in the next turn in red.  Your piece is at risk of capture if it's in a red square.
  
  Synergy: Displays the total number of friendly pieces protecting a piece as a shield value.  The shield value caps at 4, at which point the shield value becomes "4+".
           If your piece has a shield value of zero, it can be taken by the other team with no fear of retaliation.
